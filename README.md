        mapandweather use Rect,Redux,Axios and middleware section to fullfill the needs of this application. Clone the repo and use comand like "yarn install" and "yarn start" then you are ready to go on check out the port 3000 and Type the cities of Myanmar if not u won't be able to use it correctly. Otherwise change the country code in the url line and replace with any code you like!. Hope it will help u too.

 if u ran into errors, i would suggest using authorization or st like

 ### sudo yarn install
